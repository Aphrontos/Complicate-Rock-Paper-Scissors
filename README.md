# Introduction

Ǹolaniirrarat [ŋo̞̼.lä<sup>β</sup>.niːɹ.ɹä<sup>β</sup>.ɹä<sup>β</sup>t] is Koiné Gilis for "Odd Cyclic Weapons."
The traditional game of rock paper scissors only has 3 weapons. 
Have you ever wondered how a variant with more than 3 weapons work, but are too lazy to compute the strength and weaknesses?
Well wonder no long, since this code generalizes the game to any variant that has a fair strengths and weaknesses (SW) chart up to rotation.

Okay, what does a "fair SW chart" mean? 
A rock-paper-scissors variant must have:
* n number of weapons, where n ≡ 1 (mod 2) ∧ n ≥ 3 ∧ n ∈ ℤ
* each weapon must be:
  * strong against one half of weapons
  * weak to the remaining half of weapons.

The "up to rotation" part will be explained later.

Throughtout the guide, SW Labeled Adjacency Matrices (SWLAMs) will be used. Why? Because explaining how the variants work will be so much easier.

The SWLAM of the traditional rock-paper-scissors:

X            | Rock | Paper | Scissors
------------ | ---- | ----- | --------
**Rock**     | D    | W     | L
**Paper**    | L    | D     | W
**Scissors** | W    | L     | D

The SWLAM of a variant:

X            | Paper | Rock | Scissors
------------ | ----- | ---- | --------
**Paper**    | D	    | L	   | W
**Rock**     | W	    | D	   | L
**Scissors** | L	    | W	   | D

As is, this SWLAM describes the same variant as the above SWLAM, so relabelling the column and row headers is needed:

X            | Rock | Paper | Scissors
------------ | ---- | ----- | --------
**Rock**     | D    | L     | W
**Paper**    | W    | D     | L
**Scissors** | L    | W     | D

The above SWLAM doesn't really make any sense to the average person. 
So another relabelling is needed. 
What's the most neutral way to name categories? 
With numbers of course! 
So relabelling the weapons to have numbers as names:

X     | 1 | 2 | 3
----- | - | - | -
**1** | D | L | W
**2** | W | D | L
**3** | L | W | D

An example with 5 weapons:

X     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
----- | - | - | - | - | -
**1** | D | W | W | L | L
**2** | L | D | W | W | L
**3** | L | L | D | W | W
**4** | W | L | L | D | W
**5** | W | W | L | L | D

The above is the "base" 5-weapon SWLAM. 
As discussed earlier, each weapon is weak to 2 other and strong against the remaining 2.

If the rows and columns are rearranged and headers are relabeled, this gives a new but fair SWLAM.

X     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
----- | - | - | - | - | -
**1** | D | L | W | W | L
**2** | W | D | W | L | L
**3** | L | L | D | W | W
**4** | L | W | L | D | W
**5** | W | W | L | L | D

But, unfortunately, some information was lost. 
The variant code isn't known anymore. It has to be calculated for. 
To fix this:

X     | X     |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5
----- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**X** | **X** | *2* | *1* | *3* | *4* | *5*
**1** | *2*   |  D  |  L  |  W  |  W  |  L
**2** | *1*   |  W  |  D  |  W  |  L  |  L
**3** | *3*   |  L  |  L  |  D  |  W  |  W
**4** | *4*   |  L  |  W  |  L  |  D  |  W
**5** | *5*   |  W  |  W  |  L  |  L  |  D

The column and row in bold are the weapon names, while the column and row in italics are the variant code.

Now, given this, there may seem to be 5! variations, but no there are actually only 4! variations, since each variation has 5 rotations.
For example: 12345 and 23451 are the same SWLAM because they're rotations of each other.
So in general, for n weapons, there are (n-1)! SWLAM variations.

Now, why is a SWLAM an "adjacency matrix"? 
Well, if the only portion with the Ws, Ds, and Ls are taken:

 X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
 D  |  L  |  W  |  W  |  L
 W  |  D  |  W  |  L  |  L
 L  |  L  |  D  |  W  |  W
 L  |  W  |  L  |  D  |  W
 W  |  W  |  L  |  L  |  D

And relabel them such that:
* W → 1
* D → 0
* L → -1

X  | X  | X  | X  | X
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
0  | -1 | 1  | 1  | -1
1  | 0  | 1  | -1 | -1
-1 | -1 | 0  | 1  | 1
-1 | 1  | -1 | 0  | 1
1  | 1  | -1 | -1 | 0

Then this decribes a directed graph. Specifically the SW chart for the respective variant code.
